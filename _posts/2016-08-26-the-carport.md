It doesn't have A/C. It doesn't have nice green turf...It doesn't have a fancy pitching machine...It doesn't have an "L" screen...It doesn't have that fancy videogame-like display (like virtual golf) to track where you hit it...and ya...sometimes you have to chase a ball "down the hill". 

But it works.
